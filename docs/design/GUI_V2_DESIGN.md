# Curator GUI v2 design — full CLI parity + batch workflows

**Status:** Design captured 2026-05-09. **Not yet implemented.**
**Target version:** v1.7 (foundation) → v1.8 (full parity)
**Companion:** `scripts/workflows/` ships PowerShell wrappers as the interim solution.

---

## Why this exists

The current GUI (v0.34–v0.43, shipping in v1.6.1) has 8 tabs and meaningful
right-click action menus, but **discoverability is poor** and **several CLI
commands have no GUI surface at all**. Jake's working complaint: "the GUI does
not seem very intuitive to use [and lacks] batch command options to harness
the capabilities of the many tools built within it."

Two distinct gaps to close:

1. **CLI parity gap** — every CLI subcommand should have a discoverable GUI
   surface (dialog, button, panel, or menu item).
2. **Batch workflow gap** — common multi-step workflows (scan → group → review
   → apply, full asset cleanup, etc.) should be one-click.

This doc captures both.

## Current GUI surface (what exists today, v1.6.1)

### Tabs (8 total)

| Tab | What it shows | Mutation surface |
|---|---|---|
| **Inbox** | Pending review queue | `_build_inbox_tab` (line 154) |
| **Browser** | Every indexed file | Right-click → "Send to Trash" |
| **Bundles** | All bundles + member counts | Right-click → "Dissolve" / "New" / "Edit" |
| **Trash** | Trashed file records | Right-click → "Restore" (often impossible on Windows due to send2trash limitation) |
| **Migrate** | Migration jobs + per-file progress (400-line implementation with `MigrationProgressBridge` signals) | Job list, status detail |
| **Audit Log** | Audit log table | Read-only |
| **Settings** | Config table | Read-only |
| **Lineage Graph** | Visual graph of lineage edges | Read-only viewer (419 lines) |

### Menus (3 total)

| Menu | Items |
|---|---|
| **File** | Refresh, Quit |
| **Edit** | Send to Trash, Restore, Dissolve, New bundle, Edit bundle |
| **Help** | About |

### Dialogs

- `FileInspectDialog` (691 lines) — full file detail with flex attrs + lineage edges
- `BundleEditorDialog` — bundle creation/editing

## CLI commands and their GUI gap analysis

Mapping every CLI subcommand to its current GUI status:

| CLI | Has GUI surface? | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| `curator doctor` | ❌ | Need health dashboard panel (could be a Status menu item) |
| `curator sources list/show` | ⚠️ partial (Settings tab shows config; no source list) | Need dedicated Sources tab or dialog |
| `curator sources add/enable/disable/remove` | ❌ | Need source management dialog |
| `curator sources config` | ⚠️ partial (Settings tab is read-only) | Need editable config |
| `curator scan` | ❌ | Need Scan dialog with source picker + folder picker |
| `curator inspect` | ✅ | `FileInspectDialog` covers this |
| `curator group` | ❌ | Need duplicate finder dialog with --keep strategy + apply |
| `curator cleanup empty-dirs/broken-symlinks/junk/duplicates` | ❌ | Need cleanup wizard (4 sub-modes, plan vs apply) |
| `curator trash` | ✅ | Right-click in Browser tab |
| `curator restore` | ⚠️ partial (often raises RestoreImpossibleError on Windows) | Need fallback handling |
| `curator audit` | ✅ | Audit Log tab |
| `curator migrate` (Phase 1) | ❌ | Need migrate-now dialog (the existing Migrate tab is for Phase 2 jobs only) |
| `curator migrate` (Phase 2) | ✅ | Migrate tab |
| `curator organize` | ❌ | Need organize planner panel |
| `curator organize-revert` | ❌ | Need revert button in organize panel |
| `curator lineage` | ✅ | Lineage Graph tab |
| `curator bundles list/show/create/dissolve` | ✅ | Bundles tab + dialogs |
| `curator gdrive paths/status/auth` | ❌ | Need Drive auth flow UI |
| `curator watch` | ❌ | Need live-watch dashboard (real-time event stream) |
| `curator safety check/paths` | ❌ | Need path-safety widget (probably part of organize panel) |
| `curator mcp keys` | ❌ | Need MCP key management dialog (low priority — rare use) |

**Summary:** 6 fully covered, 4 partially covered, **11 fully missing**.

## Proposed v1.7 architecture (foundation: parity, then workflows)

### New menu structure

```
File           Edit              Tools (NEW)        Workflows (NEW)       Help
├─ Refresh    ├─ Send to Trash  ├─ Scan...         ├─ Initial scan       ├─ About
└─ Quit       ├─ Restore        ├─ Find Duplicates ├─ Find duplicates    └─ User Guide
              ├─ Dissolve       ├─ Cleanup Junk... ├─ Cleanup junk
              ├─ New bundle     ├─ Organize...     ├─ Drive migration
              └─ Edit bundle    ├─ Migrate...      ├─ Audit summary
                                ├─ Sources...      ├─ Health check
                                ├─ Health Check    └─ Custom...
                                ├─ Drive Auth...
                                └─ Settings...
```

### New tab: Sources

Lists all sources with columns: id, kind, status (enabled/disabled), root,
file count, last scan time. Buttons:
- **Add Source...** → dialog with kind picker (local / gdrive)
- **Enable/Disable** → toggle (no confirm)
- **Remove** → confirm dialog (warns if files reference this source)
- **Configure...** → opens config editor

### New tab: Watch (live)

Real-time view of `curator watch` events:
- Top: source picker + start/stop button
- Middle: scrolling event list (ADDED / MODIFIED / DELETED with paths + timestamps)
- Bottom: counters (events/sec, total events, current debounce window)
- Right side: option to enable `--apply` (live incremental scan)

### New dialogs

| Dialog | Purpose | Wraps |
|---|---|---|
| `ScanDialog` | Pick source + folder + ignore globs, click Scan, watch progress | `curator scan` |
| `GroupDialog` | Pick keep strategy, see preview group count, confirm to apply | `curator group --apply` |
| `CleanupDialog` | Pick path + which categories (junk/empty-dirs/symlinks), preview, apply | `curator cleanup` |
| `OrganizeDialog` | Pick source + type (music/photo/document) + target, preview path proposals | `curator organize` |
| `MigrateDialog` | Pick src + dst + workers + conflict mode, kick off Phase 1 or Phase 2 | `curator migrate --apply` |
| `SourceAddDialog` | Pick kind, fill config keys (parent_id for gdrive, etc.) | `curator sources add` |
| `DriveAuthDialog` | Run interactive OAuth, show status, paths | `curator gdrive auth` |
| `HealthCheckDialog` | Live dashboard from `curator doctor` + DB check + MCP probe | `05_health_check.ps1` content |

### Workflows menu (composite operations)

These wrap multi-step CLI sequences as single-click flows. They're modeled
on the PowerShell scripts in `scripts/workflows/` so the same logic ships
on day 1 of v1.7:

| Menu item | Backed by | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Initial scan | `01_initial_scan.ps1` | Register source if not present + scan + summary |
| Find duplicates | `02_find_duplicates.ps1` | Group --json + render report + confirm + apply |
| Cleanup junk | `03_cleanup_junk.ps1` | All 3 cleanup categories + report + confirm + apply |
| Drive migration | (script #6, not yet shipped) | gdrive auth + register Drive source + plan + apply |
| Audit summary | `04_audit_summary.ps1` | 24h grouped view of audit log |
| Health check | `05_health_check.ps1` | Full stack diagnostic |
| Custom... | (free-form) | User picks: source, action sequence, applies |

Implementation note: workflows can either spawn the existing PowerShell
scripts (simplest) or re-implement them in Python directly inside the GUI
(better integration, but more work). Recommend Phase 1 spawns scripts;
Phase 2 inlines them.

## Discoverability fixes (low effort, high value)

These are quick wins that should ship in v1.6.2 or v1.7 alpha:

1. **Add a Tools menu** — even before all the dialogs are built, surface the
   most-used CLI commands as menu items with placeholder dialogs.
2. **Add toolbar buttons** on each tab — Inbox needs "Process," Browser needs
   "Scan/Find Duplicates," Trash needs "Empty all" (with confirm). Currently
   all action lives in right-click menus.
3. **Update the docstring** of `curator gui` — it says "Read-only first ship.
   Three tabs..." which is FALSE. Currently 8 tabs and 5 mutations.
4. **Status bar workflow hints** — the status bar already shows row counts;
   add a contextual hint like "Right-click a row to see actions" or
   "Tools menu → Scan to add files."
5. **First-run tip** — on a freshly-initialized DB (file count = 0), show a
   modal: "No files indexed yet. Click Tools → Scan to start, or use
   Workflows → Initial scan."

---

## Implementation sequencing

### v1.6.2 (patch — discoverability only, ~1 session)

- [ ] Update `curator gui` docstring to reflect actual capability
- [ ] Add Tools menu (placeholder items that say "coming in v1.7")
- [ ] Add Workflows menu that calls into `scripts/workflows/*.bat` via subprocess
- [ ] First-run modal for empty DB
- [ ] Status bar hints

### v1.7.0 (foundation — full parity for high-value commands, ~2-3 sessions)

- [ ] `ScanDialog` — single most-needed dialog
- [ ] `GroupDialog` + apply
- [ ] `CleanupDialog` (4 sub-modes)
- [ ] Sources tab + `SourceAddDialog`
- [ ] `HealthCheckDialog`
- [ ] Audit Log tab: filter UI (since-hours, action, actor)
- [ ] Tools menu populated with real dialogs (not placeholders)

### v1.8.0 (polish + advanced surfaces, ~2 sessions)

- [ ] `OrganizeDialog`
- [ ] `MigrateDialog` (Phase 1 trigger from GUI; Phase 2 already in Migrate tab)
- [ ] `DriveAuthDialog`
- [ ] Watch tab (live event stream)
- [ ] `SafetyCheckDialog`
- [ ] Settings tab: editable config (no longer read-only)

### v1.9.0 (workflows native + lifecycle integration, ~2-3 sessions)

- [ ] Workflows menu items reimplemented in Python (no longer subprocess to PS)
- [ ] Custom workflow builder (drag actions, save as template)
- [ ] Integration with `atrium-reversibility` once that ships (per
  `Atrium/design/LIFECYCLE_GOVERNANCE.md`) — staged actions, rollback UI,
  blocked-version banners

## Tech notes

- **PySide6 is sufficient** for everything proposed. No need to switch to
  Tauri/Electron/web stack.
- **Reuse existing models** — `AuditLogTableModel`, `BundleTableModel`,
  `FileTableModel`, etc. already exist in `src/curator/gui/models.py`. New
  dialogs should add new models, not reinvent.
- **Background work via `QThread`** — scans, group computations, migrations
  must not block the UI thread. The existing `MigrationProgressBridge`
  pattern (in `migrate_signals.py`) is the model.
- **Test surface** — `pytest-qt` is already a dev dependency. Every new
  dialog gets a `tests/gui/test_*_dialog.py`.

---

## What this design does NOT cover

- **GUI workflow builder UX research** — drag-and-drop action composition
  is a real UX task; the v1.9 sketch above is rough.
- **Mobile / web access** — out of scope; PySide6 desktop only.
- **Multi-window** — currently one window; future could open multiple
  Browser tabs for different sources.
- **Localization** — English-only for v1.x.

---

## Open questions for next iteration

- Should the Sources tab become the *primary* tab (replacing Inbox as default)?
  Sources are how you start; Inbox is for ongoing triage. New users hit
  Inbox-empty and don't know what to do.
- Should workflows be modal (block UI until done) or asynchronous (run in
  background, queue panel)? Phase 2 migrations are already async; consistency
  argues for async everywhere, but it's more work.
- How does the Watch tab interact with the Browser tab? Should new files
  appear live in Browser when Watch is running with `--apply`?
- Should the Settings tab editing flow auto-restart Curator processes that
  cache the config? Or just warn that changes take effect next launch?
